# Microservices and the Kingdom of Tartaria
## History of the Kingdom of Tartaria
From the 15th century to the early 19th century, there was a kingdom on Earth called Tartaria, which has been erased from history.
This kingdom valued individuality and was full of love and harmony, possessing advanced technology.<br>
The Tartarians lived on free energy, generating electricity from the air called ether, and distributing it wirelessly to various locations. Additionally, the currently popular 3D printing construction technology is said to have originated from Tartarian technology. Renaissance buildings in Italy are believed to have been constructed using 3D printers at that time. (When you think about it, it's not something that could be built by human hands alone.)<br>
However, Tartaria was destroyed and erased from history in the early 19th century by DS's nuclear bombs and the mud flood.

## Microservices and the Kingdom of Tartaria
This is just my intuition, but I believe that [the microservices explained on the previous page](./it-technology-and-spirituality.md) originally came from Tartarian technology.<br>
Given that electricity existed in that era and the concepts of individuality, love, and harmony are reflected in microservices, I can't help but feel this way. (This intuition came to me while working with k8s.)<br>
Furthermore, since DevOps and agile development, which are well-suited to microservices, are based on horizontal connections, I can't help but feel that these methods also originated from Tartaria.<br>
Engineers involved in microservices might have a connection to Tartaria in their past lives.

Next, [I will explain about the first civilization of humanity and ancient Japanese people](./the-first-human-civilization-and-ancient-japanese-people.md)<br>
â†’ It is no exaggeration to say that this is the origin of individuality, love, harmony, and microservices.
