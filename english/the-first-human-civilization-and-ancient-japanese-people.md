# The First Civilization of Humanity and Ancient Japanese People
## The First Civilization and Its Demise
Humans were created by aliens as personnel to dig up Earth's minerals, which are materials for spaceships. (They did not evolve from apes.)<br>
After most of these aliens left, the first human civilizations were created. These were the Atlantis civilization and the Lemuria civilization.
The former civilization developed on the continent of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean and was the first class society of humanity.
The latter flourished on the continent of Mu in the Pacific Ocean and was the first society of individuality, love, and harmony for humanity.<br>
The Atlantis civilization expanded its control and turned most of the Earth into a class society. The federation of the Milky Way galaxy, where Earth exists, judged that leaving the Atlantis civilization unchecked would negatively affect other planets, and about 10,000 years ago, they caused a great flood across the Earth, destroying the civilization. The Lemuria civilization also ended as a milestone of civilization at this time.

## Ancient Japanese People
About 10,000 years ago, the great flood submerged most of the Mu continent under the sea, but some islands remained. One of these was the Japanese archipelago, and those who survived on this island were the ancient Japanese people (also known as Laputans). The ancient Japanese people crossed the seas and spread across the Earth, conveying the spirit of Lemuria to the world, harmonizing with the local people, and building megalithic civilizations.

The ideas of Lemuria were passed down through the ages, connecting to the Kingdom of Tartaria and eventually to modern microservices.
