# What We Need to Do
At the time of Earth's dimensional ascension, depending on each individual's vibrations and will, they will either remain on Earth or move to another planet. In the former case, they will graduate from their physical bodies and exist solely as souls. In the latter case, it will vary according to the dimension of the planet.<br>
What we need to do is **to face how we want to live and what we want to do in the future, that is, to  face the way of living of our soul**.<br>
How you face it is up to you to decide. That is what free will is all about.
